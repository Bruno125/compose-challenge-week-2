# Basketball Countdown Timer
![Workflow result](https://github.com/bruno125/compose-challenge-week-2/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description
This app allows you to manage the timers for a basketball game, which has:
- a 24-seconds shot clock for each play
- a 12-minute time clock for each quarter.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

Motivation:
My very first Android app 8 years ago was a (much more simple) basketball timer as well.
I'm happy to see not only my progress over the years, but also Android's with Compose.

Interesting features:
- Canvas API: the digital board is drawn manually using Compose's powerful `Canvas` API.
- States: redraw is triggered by state changes
- Animations: when the shot clock runs out of time, a rainbow animation is performed using `Animation` APIs.
